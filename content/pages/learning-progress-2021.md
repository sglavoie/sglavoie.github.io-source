> Learning is an eternal path. I wanted to share my own
> adventure primarily for the following practical reasons: to
> help me remember what I have been working on technology-wise
> and to help me practice a technique known as [spaced
> repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). This
> is a summary to motivate myself to keep on track, to practice
> consistent self-reflection and to be reminded as often as possible
> to stay a bit more humble. In the process, I hope you may find some
> inspiration too.
